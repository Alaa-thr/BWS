Dear Alaa,
I'm Tahraoui Alaa, and i'm from Algeria, my native language is Arabic. In my country the communication culture it is high- context. This means that we emphasize interpersonal relationships, and developing trust is the first step. When you want to texted us i would like from you to write a formel email + add a thankfull words. For the three most important things to remember are:
1- The email has to be clear, brief, formal.
2- Consediring the Comunication Culture, Age, Genger.
3- Adding the Thankfull Words.
In this courses i received a lot of advices but the best is "Never complaining or blaming the reader".
Well, that all what i have. hope you enjoyed with reading this email, and  GOOD LUCK.
Best Regards,
Tahraoui Alaa.
